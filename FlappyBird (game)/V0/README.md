# Flappy Bird Framework

The python Flappy Bird framework will allow students to create their own Flappy Bird game, similar to [https://studio.code.org/flappy/1](https://studio.code.org/flappy/1), but using python instead of scratch.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install the following packages:
```
pip3 install pygame
pip3 install py2exe 
```

### Running

Use our API (under construction) to fill in flappy.py 
To see your customized Flappy Bird game in action: 

```

```
